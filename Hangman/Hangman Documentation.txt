Hangman Game Documentation
* To start the program, click on the file, open it, and run it in an IDE (jGrasp is recommended).
* To play the game is simple. Click on the red button on the right hand side of the screen to start the game. Then, a new screen will pop up with alphabet tiles, the hangman stand, and dashes. The dashes represent the amount of letters the word you will be guessing is. In order to select a letter guess, click the tile of your choice. Then the tile will turn green and one of two things will happen, either a letter will popup on the dashes, or a piece of the hangman’s body will be added to the stand. The letter popping up on the dashes means that you have successfully guessed a letter! You can use your gained knowledge to help you continue the game. Having a new body part of hangman means that you guessed incorrectly. In the game you have 8 wrong guesses available, so choose wisely! After the button turns greed, DO NOT CLICK THE BUTTON AGAIN. Most importantly, have fun!
Troubleshooting:
* If the applet is only partially showing, you need to change the size of the applet window of your compiler. It needs to be a width of 1000px and a height of 650px. For jGrasp you should go to “Settings”, then “Compiler Settings”, then “Workspace”, and select java, click “Applet HTML”, copy the text, uncheck the default box, paste the text back into the box, change width and height, and then press apply.
